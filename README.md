This contains the HTML source, as well as the webserver and Dockerfile for my complete website.

Note that these are all intentionally very minimal, in the aim of learning Rust.

The webserver is a modified version of the project in [Chapter 20](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html) of _The Rust Programming Language_ book.
